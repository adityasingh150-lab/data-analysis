Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) during my Data Analytics internship at CodeAlpha. Explored dataset, asked key questions, identified patterns, and used visuals to extract insights. Excited to continue learning and take on the next task!Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) - CodeAlpha Internship Overview

This project showcases my work during my Data Analytics internship at CodeAlpha. During this project, I performed Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a provided dataset to uncover insights, patterns, and trends that help to make data-driven decisions. The main goal was to explore the data, ask key questions, visualize important patterns, and extract actionable insights.

Project Highlights

Data Exploration: Gained a deeper understanding of the dataset through descriptive statistics and basic visualizations.

Key Questions: Defined and explored important questions to guide the analysis.

Pattern Identification: Used various techniques to identify trends, correlations, and outliers in the dataset.

Data Cleaning: Preprocessed and cleaned the data to ensure high-quality insights.

Visualizations: Created a variety of visualizations (e.g., histograms, scatter plots, box plots, heatmaps) to highlight important patterns.

Insights: Extracted actionable insights that can inform future data-driven decisions.

Key Tools & Technologies Used

Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

Jupyter Notebooks (for running and documenting the analysis)

SQL (if applicable, for data extraction or querying)

Git (for version control)

Analysis Process

Data Loading & Inspection:

Imported the dataset and performed initial checks.

Checked for missing values and handled them appropriately.

Descriptive Statistics:

Generated basic statistics like mean, median, standard deviation, and quartiles.

Visualizations:

Created histograms, box plots, scatter plots, and heatmaps to visualize key patterns and distributions.

Identifying Trends:

Identified correlations between different variables.

Analyzed relationships to answer key questions.

Data Cleaning:

Handled missing data, outliers, and performed necessary data transformations.

Key Insights:

Summarized the major findings and potential actionable insights from the analysis.

Key Questions Explored

What are the relationships between different features in the dataset?

Are there any noticeable trends or outliers in the data?

How does one variable impact another in terms of correlation or distribution?

What insights can be drawn for business strategy or future analysis?

Next Steps

Iâ€™m excited to continue exploring more advanced techniques in Data Analytics and Machine Learning as I progress in my internship.

My next steps include further refining the models and applying more sophisticated statistical methods to gain deeper insights.

Conclusion

This project was an exciting opportunity to apply my knowledge of data analytics in a real-world context. I look forward to continuing my learning journey and taking on new challenges at CodeAlpha!
